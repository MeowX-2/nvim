# Neovim Configuration

This is a Neovim configuration based on Lua. It uses `lazy.nvim` for plugin management.

## Project Overview

This project is a personal Neovim configuration. It's designed to be a lightweight and modern setup for text editing, with a focus on web development (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, TypeScript), LaTeX, and competitive programming in C++.

The configuration is structured around `lazy.nvim`, a modern plugin manager for Neovim. Plugins are defined in individual files under the `lua/plugins/` directory.

### Key Features:

*   **Plugin Manager:** `lazy.nvim`
*   **Language Server Protocol (LSP):** `nvim-lspconfig` with `mason.nvim` for managing LSP servers.
*   **Completions:** `nvim-cmp` with `luasnip`.
*   **Fuzzy Finder:** `telescope.nvim`.
*   **Git Integration:** `gitsigns.nvim`.
*   **Color Scheme:** `gruvbox-material`, `nightfox`, and a custom theme `ofirkai`.

## Key Files

*   `init.lua`: The main entry point of the configuration. It sets up `lazy.nvim` and loads the plugins.
*   `lua/vim-options.lua`: Sets various Vim options, such as indentation settings, key mappings, and auto-commands.
*   `lua/plugins/`: This directory contains the configuration for all the plugins. Each file corresponds to a plugin or a set of related plugins.
    *   `lsp-config.lua`: Configures the Language Server Protocol (LSP) clients for various languages.
    *   `completions.lua`: Sets up the completion engine (`nvim-cmp`) and snippets (`luasnip`).
    *   `telescope.lua`: Configures the fuzzy finder for files, buffers, and more.
*   `lazy-lock.json`:  This file is automatically generated by `lazy.nvim` and locks the versions of the installed plugins.

## Development Conventions

The configuration is written in Lua. The code is modular, with each plugin's configuration in its own file.

*   **Plugin Management:** Plugins are managed by `lazy.nvim`. To add a new plugin, create a new file in the `lua/plugins/` directory that returns a table with the plugin's specification.
*   **Key Mappings:** Key mappings are set using `vim.keymap.set()`. Global key mappings are defined in `lua/vim-options.lua`, while plugin-specific key mappings are defined in their respective plugin configuration files.
*   **LSP:** LSP servers are automatically installed and configured using `mason.nvim` and `mason-lspconfig.nvim`.

## Building and Running

This is a Neovim configuration, so there is no "building" or "running" in the traditional sense. To use this configuration, you need to have Neovim installed.

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url> ~/.config/nvim
    ```
2.  **Start Neovim:**
    ```bash
    nvim
    ```
    On the first run, `lazy.nvim` will automatically install all the plugins.
